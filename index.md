# The Doctor
The Doctor is a timelord or rather the last timelord. Together with his TARDIS he travelles through time and space. Due a breakdown in the camouflage (or however it is called) it is stuck to the appearance of a police box. 

## How to spot The Doctor
Well, as The Doctor regenerates from time to time and gets a new appearal, it is not easy to recognize him. But there are some hints:
* the nearby tardis
* strange outfit
* always in a hurry and slightly confused
* if asked by his/her name you just get "The Doctor"
* more detailed question will lead to "just The Doctor"
* you just stumbled across some cyber men or daleks (glad you survived!)

> "I'm The Doctor!"
